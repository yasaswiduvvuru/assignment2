    <h1 id="headah"> Human? ... or pathetic excuse for a form filling troll bot? </h1>
	<p id="intro"> Have you ever struggled with the crazy text even though you are not a bot
	    simply because it is hard to decipher. The eyesore that is the header reflects my feelings towards those types of verification.  
		I am glad that more advanced sites 
		are moving towards pictorial verification of humanity. It would be cool to
		do that, but my battery of organic verification techniques are primitive.
		However, my lack of technical prowess is made up with slightly harder than 
		average questions.
